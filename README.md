# thehappening
This is my simple Flask example. I decided to see if I could make a thing using Flask and buttons and GET and POST stuff like that. I wanted the thing to resemble this popular image:

The inital version has a few problems. Please feel free to make comments, issues, or PR. Take it and use it if you like.
